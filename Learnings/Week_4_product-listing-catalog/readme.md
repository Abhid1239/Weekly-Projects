This is the API we are going to use to get our data: https://geektrust.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/coding-problems/shopping-cart/catalogue.json

this is a online clothes data where we can add filters of:
 Gender 
 Colour 
 Price range 
 Type 
As for search we can use:
Name 
 Colour 
 Type 
 Eg. green polo

Try to create your own design however possible also the data set filter has price range so figure out a way to create a price range using maximum and minimu values.


You can make the UI any way you want

 Every t-shirt type has a limited quantity. If the customer tries to order more than the available quantity, an error message should appear. 
 Filter can be applied by itself or on top of the search results. 
 Filters and Search need not be retained on navigation between pages, But the items in the cart should be retained. 
 The mockup provided is only a sample so that you have an indication of what is expected from you. You could choose to go with a completely different user experience. But you will need to ensure that all requirements mentioned in the problem are covered & there should be navigation between screens. 
 All features (search, filter, add to cart etc) should be handled on the client side. 
 There are no API's provided for these features. 
 There is no need to handle pagination. 
 There is no need to implement user registration / login.
